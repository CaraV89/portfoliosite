        <p>I am a freelance graphic designer who loves to help make client's visions become reality.

I am very passionate about the work I do and making sure it's the best quality work that I can produce. I am a very focused individual when it comes to projects that I work on. I love to take inspiration from clients, the world around me and designers that I find to be inspiring for me.</p>

                 <h4>"Fly Me to the Moon"</h4>
                    <p>This piece was inspired by one of my all-time favorite singers, Frank Sinatra. I used a combination of five images to manipulate them into one image.</p>
            <img class="borns" src="https://i.imgsafe.org/8cadd7d012.jpg">
                <h4>"Gestalt Abstraction"</h4>
                    <p>This project was one of my favorite designs I created, strictly inspired by a son called, "10,000 Emerald Pools" by the BORNS. I used previously created shapes from an image trace and created an abstract pattern on an edited image. </p>
            <img class="unity" src="https://i.imgsafe.org/8cad635b72.jpg">
                <h4>"Propaganda"</h4>
                    <p>This design was created as a propaganda piece, using multiple typefaces to create one large typeface. The message is brought across directly and neatly. </p>
